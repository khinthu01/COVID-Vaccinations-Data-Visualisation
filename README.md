# COVID-19 Vaccinations Data Visualisation Dashboards

## Description of the Project
The data visualisations were created using Power BI desktop and was made for the Power BI Project as part of the  Microsoft Student Accelerator Program. There Power BI report file consists of three pages which convey global COVID-19 vaccination data broken down by countries, country income levels, vaccine manufacturer, date and age. 

## Datasets Used
The data used for the dashboards were obtained from two sources: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL and https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress. The datasets from these two sources are also included in the Datasets folder as .csv files. 

The datasets contain information on COVID-19 worldwide vaccination rates and they were chosen as vaccinating the global population is key to reducing the harm posed by COVID-19 and offers hope for a way out of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted communities and economies around the world. Presenting information on the current vaccine data provides insight into our current progress and highlights disparities in vaccination rates among different categories and demographics.

## Using the Dashboard

## Key Insights
As mentioned in the video demonstration of the dashboard, the key insights drawn from the data can be seen on the last page of the report as shown below.

The data showed that currently 5.73billion COVID-19 vaccinations had been administered and around 30% of the world's population is fully vaccinated however the data also showed a large disparity in vaccination rates between low income and high income countries which highlights the troubling fact that while high income countries prepare to safely exit lockdowns after reaching vaccination targets, this will likely not be the case for many low income countries for some time.
