# COVID-19 Vaccinations Data Visualisation Dashboards

## Description of the Project
The data visualisations were created using Power BI desktop and was made for the Power BI Project as part of the  Microsoft Student Accelerator Program. The Power BI report file consists of three pages which convey global COVID-19 vaccination data broken down by countries, country income levels, vaccine manufacturer, date and age. 

## Datasets Used
The datasets containing information on COVID-19 vaccination rates worldwide were used for the dashboards and were obtained from two sources: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL and https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress. The datasets from these two sources are also included in the Datasets folder as .csv files. 

This topic was chosen because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts on communities and economies around the world and vaccines offer hope for reducing the harm posed by the virus and helping the world find a way to live with COVID. As such, data describing vaccination rates worldwide has been of much interest as much of the world is eager to end lockdowns and travel restrictions to make our way to normalcy. Presenting information on the current vaccine data provides insight into our current progress and highlights disparities in vaccination rates among different categories and demographics.

## Using the Dashboard

## Key Insights
As mentioned in the video demonstration of the dashboard, the key insights drawn from the data can be seen on the last page of the report as shown below.

The data showed that currently 5.73 billion COVID-19 vaccinations had been administered and around 30% of the world's population is fully vaccinated however the data also showed a large disparity in vaccination rates between low income and high income countries which highlights the troubling fact that while high income countries prepare to safely exit lockdowns after reaching vaccination targets, this will likely not be the case for many low income countries for some time.
There were also large differences in vaccination rates between the 65+ age group and under 65 age group, however that was to be expected given the prioritisation of the vulnerable elderly community during initial vaccine rollouts across the world.

Other insights:
* Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are by far the most administered vaccines across the world
* Despite vaccine rollouts beginning early 2021, a large portion of the vaccination population in many countries have only received one dose - the fraction of fully vaccinated people varies widely across different countries
